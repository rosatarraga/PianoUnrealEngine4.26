# Unreal Engine 4.26 Virtual Reality Piano

For Virtual and Augmented Reality subject in UCLM esiiab, I developed an interactive piano.


### Blueprints and materials

It is composed mainly of 7 blueprints that reproduces different sounds (Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si). They interact everytime they are touched through the mobile phone. When it reproduces a sound, it moves in the space, simulating the touch stimuli .
These blueprints are based on Trace Interaction-Interface.
The blueprints have different references to the folder Music where all sounds are stored.  Moreover folder Materials contains the colors for the different keys.
